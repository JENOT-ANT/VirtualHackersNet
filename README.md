## ðŸ“œ Description:
  - A **text/commands game** based on a **Discord server**, that simulates a **virtual network**. 
  - **The final idea behind it is simple: join (or gather) squad, protect your game's virtual machine, hack others, trade and gather virtual currency.**
  - **You can join game here** -> **https://discord.gg/dgZWHX6E** (I'm trying to keep this invitation link active, but if you found it outdated, just let me know in the `Discussions` tab) and become one of the first member of the community!
    > right now the game is in an early stage of developement and the major part of planned features dosen't work.
